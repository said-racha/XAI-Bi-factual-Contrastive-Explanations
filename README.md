Through this project, we were able to design and develop software capable of adapting to different types of given problems to provide a set of bi-factual causes. 
Bi-factual causes, distinct from counterfactual causes, are formalized by Tim Miller in his article *"Contrastive Explanation: A Structural-Model Approach."* 
There are no previous works that have put this issue into practice.
